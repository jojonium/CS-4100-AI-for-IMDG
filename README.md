# CS 4100: AI for IMGD

Projects and classwork for CS 4100: Artificial Intelligence for Interactive
Media and Games.

Most of these are little one-off projects or readings, but two repos are
included as submodules.

The Mario Level Generator and AI Agent project is in a [a separate
repository](https://github.com/jojonium/Mario-AI-Framework), as is the [final
project](https://github.com/bandaloo/proc-cave-game). They are both included
here as submodules. To automatically download them, just do:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

The Final Project is by far the most impressive: it's a complete top-down
rogue-lite twin stick shooter in the style of _The Binding of Isaac_ and
_Nuclear Throne_. Check out that project's
[repo](https://github.com/bandaloo/proc-cave-game) for more info.
