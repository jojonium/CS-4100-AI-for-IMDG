## Algorithms and Approaches: Chapter 26, Procedural Generation in Game Design

Questions:

  - When experimenting with using a particular method for randomly generating
    some desired characteristic, e.g. making caves with a cellular automaton, is
	there some better way for guiding these experiments than guessing and seeing
    what looks good?

  - What is the relative performance of these algorithms? What are some of the
    drawbacks of using one over another?

  - How can these techniques be applied to AI? For example, how can we randomly
    generate realistic/interesting NPC actions?

Takeaways:

  - There are a few general techniques and algorithms that are commonly used for
    generating random content.

  - Each of these techniques are just tools with upsides and downsides for
    different situations. Consider which ones might be useful in different
    situations.

``Procedural generation opens endless doors in endless hallways to endless
untracked worlds.''

## So you want to build a generatorâ€¦

Questions:

  - What's a good way to narrow down your artifacts to make describing
    constraints easier?

  - What are some techniques for filtering out ugly, boring, or otherwise
    undesireable generated content?

  - What are some of the downsides of agent-based generation?

Takeaways:

  - Define your what you want your generator to do as strictly as possible.

  - Test your generators a lot to make sure they succeed at making interesting
    content that fits your constraints

Quote:

``The most common way that generators fail is that they produce content that
fails to be interesting.''


## Ethical bot-making

Questions:

  - What happens when ``do no harm'' is ambiguous? What if a self-driving car
    has to choose between running over a group of pedestrians or swerving into a
    wall and possibly killing its owner?

  - The article says that creators are not completely absolved of responsibility
    when users misuse their bots, but where do we draw the line? If the creator
    tries their best to make an inoffensive chatbot but it is still abused into
    becoming racist (e.g. Microsoft's Tay), is it still the creator's
    responsibility?

  - What defines a good-faith attempt to prevent a bot from acting unethically?

Takeaways:

  - Keep in mind the possible negative actions your bot could do, because you
    are still responsible for them.

  - Monitor your bots and make it easy for users to report errors or problematic
    content.
